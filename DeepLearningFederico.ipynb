In N-HPatches problem, we aim to generate a patch descriptor that is able to perform successfully tasks such as matching, retrieval or verification. \n","\n","Contrary to classical HPatches dataset, in N-HPatches, images contain random non-smooth perturbations produced by a synthetic noise. This noise could be critical when training the descriptor, therefore, we introduce a denoising model that could help us to deal with those perturbations. Denoising models have been already introduced in the course [tutorials](https://github.com/MatchLab-Imperial/deep-learning-course) and lectures, their objective is to generate a clean/denoised version of the input image.  We will refer in this code to the images with noise as `noisy`, to the images after applying the denoise model as `denoised` and the original patches from HPatches (so no extra noise added) which are used as ground-truth for the denoising step as `clean`. \n","\n","\n","Thus, we aim to minimize the noise in images before the second step, which is computing a feature vector, also called descriptor. Those descriptions must be a powerful representation of the input patches. The idea behind is that if two descriptors belong two similar patches, they should be close to each other, i.e. have a low Euclidean distance. See figure below:\n","\n","![](https://i.ibb.co/4tvm3Vh/descriptorspace.png)\n","\n","This baseline code gives a method you can use to compare to whatever another approach you develop.  There are several other approaches you can test to see if there is any improvement, e.g. train the descriptor directly with noisy patches, without the denoising model. However, this code provides some guidance about how to implement the different blocks, how to stack them if desired, how to read the data and how to evaluate the method.\n","\n","The values given can be improved without changing the core method, only by tuning correctly the hyperparameters or giving it more training time, among others.\n","\n","As a first step of the project, you should get familiar with the problem and the provided code, so you can develop more complex and robust algorithms afterward.

we trained a model that given a noisy patch, outputs a denoised version of it. We hoped that by doing so, we will improve the performance of the second part, which is training a network that outputs the descriptor. As we mentioned, a descriptor is a numerical vector that represents the small images we have. The dataset consists of a large number of small images, which are cropped patches from other larger images. Hence, they represent some local part of a scene. That is why there are no objects represented, only corners or textures. Each of these patches is related to a subset of other patches of the dataset by some kind of geometric transformation (e.g. rotation).  For a given patch, we want the network to output a vector that is close to the vectors of the patches that represent the same local part of a scene, while being far from patches do not represent that local part of a scene.\n","\n","To do so, we will build a convolutional neural network that takes the input of $32\\times32$ and outputs a descriptor of size $128$. For the loss, we use the triplet loss, which takes an anchor patch, a negative patch and a positive patch. The idea is to train the network so the descriptors from the anchor and positive patch have a low distance between them, and the negative and anchor patch have a large distance between them. \n","\n","In this cell we generate a triplet network, which is a network formed by three copies of the same network. That means that the descriptor model will compute the descriptor for the input `'a'` (anchor), the same descriptor model (with the same weights) will compute the descriptor for the input `'p'` (positive), and again the same model will compute the descriptor for the input `'n'` (negative).

It reads the patches. The output of read_image_file is a tuple of the form (images, labels), which is passed to the class `DataGeneratorDesc`. This class is a generator that creates batches of triplets, and each epoch is defined by the number of triplets in the argument `num_triplets`.\n","\n","**Updated**: In the previous version of the baseline code, we were training the descriptor model with the noisy patches, not with the denoised ones. By adding the argument `denoise_model=denoise_model` to the class HPatches we can use the denoised images instead to train this descriptor model (if `denoise_model=None`, the noisy patches will be used). However, as it has to compute the denoised patch first, the loading of the data will be slower (6/7 extra min).  If you want to train the model with the clean patches instead, you can set the argument `use_clean=True`. In this last case, even if a denoise model is given, it will not be used. When running this piece of code **the type of patches (denoised, noisy or clean) used is printed**."]},{"metadata":{"id":"YIR1cH4fDwKj","colab_type":"code","outputId":"01935823-b935-4bc6-f2cc-1cf292150096","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1553109755559,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":63221,"user":{"displayName":"FEDERICO
